# hello-world
## organization that isn't quite coding ... or is. I can't tell.
 I'm an Eagle Scout that's makes alot of promises but has a hard time keeping them. Mostly due to a poor attention span. I don't know much about what I'm doing and I still can't use that penil icon I was supposed to use. Why is that pencil not working? I have no clue why. I should probably use that zoom meeting introduction to figure it out instead of mucking around in my sorrow.
